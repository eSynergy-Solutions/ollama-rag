        "response": "There is no specific grant mentioned in the documents provided for creating a woodland, but there are grants available for woodland creation, protection of tree health, attracting private investment in nature projects, and funding for research and innovation. However, it's essential to note that the Calf Housing for Health and Welfare grant guidance mentions the England Woodland Creation Grant (EWCO) which provides up to \u00a310,200 per hectare with additional funds if the woodland delivers wider benefits to society, nature recovery, and the environment.\n\nTo create a woodland, you can consider applying for regional woodland creation grants through local Community Forests or the Forestry Commission's campaign. For tree health protection, you can apply to the CS Woodland Tree Health grant or the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF) for funding. Additionally, there are grants available for attracting private investment in nature projects and funding research and innovation.\n\nIt's recommended to check the official government websites for the most up-to-date information on these grants and funding opportunities."
